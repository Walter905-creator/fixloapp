# 🚨 URGENT: Frontend Still Shows Old URL - Deployment Required

## ✅ Problem Status

**Your LOCAL code is FIXED:**
- ✅ Subscribe.js now hardcoded to `https://handyman-connect-backend.onrender.com`
- ✅ Build files contain the correct URL
- ✅ Public directory is ready for deployment

**Your DEPLOYED code is OUTDATED:**
- ❌ Still shows: `🔗 Using API URL: https://handyman-connect-1-ftz8.onrender.com`
- ❌ Making requests to wrong backend URL
- ❌ Deployed at: `https://handyman-connect-1-ftz8.onrender.com`

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### Step 1: Go to Render Dashboard
1. Visit your Render dashboard
2. Find your static site: `handyman-connect-1`
3. Click on the service

### Step 2: Manual Deploy
1. Click **"Manual Deploy"** button
2. Wait for deployment to complete
3. Monitor the build logs

### Step 3: Verify Fix
After deployment, the console should show:
```
🔗 Using API URL: https://handyman-connect-backend.onrender.com
```

## 📋 Deployment Configuration

Use this configuration in Render:

**Build Command:**
```bash
npm install && cd client && npm install && npm run build && cd .. && rm -rf public && mkdir -p public && cp -r client/build/* public/
```

**Publish Directory:**
```
public
```

## ✅ Expected Result

After redeployment:
- ✅ Console will show correct URL
- ✅ Subscribe button will work
- ✅ No more 400 errors
- ✅ Stripe checkout will function

## 🎯 The Fix is Ready - Just Deploy!

Your code is completely fixed. The only thing needed is to **redeploy the frontend service** to pick up the changes.
