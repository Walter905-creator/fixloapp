## 🚨 **MULTIPLE VERCEL PROJECTS DETECTED!**

### 🔍 **THE PROBLEM:**
You have **4 different Vercel projects**:
1. `handyman-backend` - Backend on Vercel?
2. `handyman-connect` - Frontend #1?
3. `handyman-connect-1` - Frontend #2?
4. `handyman-connect-1-f6ry` - Frontend #3?

This is causing **massive deployment conflicts** and confusion about which URLs to use!

### 🎯 **WHICH PROJECT IS LIVE?**

Based on your earlier error logs, I suspect `handyman-connect-1-f6ry` is the one that's actually live at `www.handyman-connect.com` because:
- The error showed `handyman-connect-1-f6ry-git-main-walters-projects-b292b340.vercel.app`
- This matches the naming pattern

### 🔍 **IMMEDIATE DIAGNOSIS:**

Let's figure out which project is which:

#### **FOR EACH PROJECT, CHECK:**
1. **Domains:** Which has `www.handyman-connect.com`?
2. **Status:** Ready, Error, or Building?
3. **Source:** Which GitHub repo?
4. **Last Deployment:** When was it updated?
5. **Build Logs:** Any errors?

### � **CRITICAL ISSUE:**

If `handyman-connect-1-f6ry` is your live site, then:
- ❌ It might not have our latest Git changes
- ❌ It might have different Vercel settings
- ❌ It's using the old backend URL

### 🎯 **ACTION PLAN:**

1. **IDENTIFY THE LIVE PROJECT** (probably `handyman-connect-1-f6ry`)
2. **UPDATE ITS SETTINGS** with correct configuration
3. **DELETE THE OTHER 3 PROJECTS** to eliminate confusion
4. **ENSURE ONE CLEAN DEPLOYMENT**

### 📋 **PLEASE TELL ME:**

For `handyman-connect-1-f6ry` specifically:
- **Does it have `www.handyman-connect.com` domain?**
- **What's its current status?**
- **What GitHub repo is it connected to?**
- **What are its build settings?**

**This explains why our Git pushes aren't fixing the frontend - we might be updating the wrong project!**
