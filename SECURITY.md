## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. Never commit `.env` files with real credentials
2. Use strong, unique passwords for admin accounts
3. Rotate JWT secrets regularly
4. Use environment variables for all sensitive data

### For Deployment
1. Set secure environment variables in production
2. Use HTTPS for all production deployments
3. Enable rate limiting in production
4. Monitor logs for suspicious activity
