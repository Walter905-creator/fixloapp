**Apple's Feedback**: "The app exhibited one or more bugs that would negatively impact users. Bug description: Sign Up and Login buttons are unresponsive when we tapped on it. Furthermore, no actions took place when we tapped in Homeowner dashboard."

**Resolution**:

### Issue 4: Guideline 2.3.3 - Inadequate Screenshots ✅

## ⚠️ Critical Notes

4. ✅ Verify all buttons are responsive on iPad

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:
- ❌ **Don't skip IAP configuration** - App will be rejected if product ID doesn't exist
- ❌ **Don't use only login screenshots** - Show actual app functionality
- ❌ **Don't skip iPad testing** - Apple specifically tested on iPad
- ❌ **Don't modify the working code** - All issues are fixed

### What's Already Done:
- ✅ Icons are professional and final
- ✅ IAP is properly implemented
- ✅ All buttons are responsive
- ✅ iPad layouts are optimized
- ✅ Documentation is complete
