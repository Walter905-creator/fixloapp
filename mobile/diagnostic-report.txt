=== FIXLO iOS APP DIAGNOSTIC REPORT ===
Date: $(date)

1. CONFIGURATION STATUS:
✅ app.config.ts exists (version 1.0.3, build 24)
✅ app.config.js removed (conflict resolved)
✅ Icon: RGB mode, 1024x1024 (Apple compliant)
✅ Environment: EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL set

2. IDENTIFIED ISSUES:

A. App.js Initialization Logic:
   - initializeServices() runs async operations without proper error boundaries
   - Socket initialization might hang if API is unreachable
   - Background fetch registration could fail silently
   - No timeout handling for service initialization
   
B. Potential Blocking Points:
   - Line 126: initializeSocket() - might hang waiting for connection
   - Line 129: offlineQueue.initialize() - NetInfo listener setup
   - Line 132: messagingService.initialize() - socket dependency
   - Line 137: checkSession() - AsyncStorage read
   - Line 140: registerBackgroundFetch() - TaskManager/Notifications permissions

C. Root Cause Analysis:
   - The app sets isLoading = false only AFTER all services initialize
   - If any service hangs (socket, permissions, etc.), loading never ends
   - User sees perpetual loading screen or welcome screen

3. RECOMMENDED FIXES:

1. Add timeout to initializeServices (max 10 seconds)
2. Make all service initializations non-blocking with try/catch
3. Allow app to render even if services fail to initialize
4. Add fallback initialization for socket/messaging
5. Make background fetch registration optional (don't block on failure)
