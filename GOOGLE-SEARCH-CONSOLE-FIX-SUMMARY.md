# Google Search Console Indexing Issues - FIXED ✅

## Summary of Issues Fixed

This PR completely resolves the Google Search Console indexing issues that were causing 416 pages to be marked as "Duplicate without user-selected canonical" and other SEO problems.

## Root Cause Analysis

The primary issue was that all SPA routes were returning the homepage canonical URL (`https://www.fixloapp.com/`) instead of their route-specific canonical URLs. This happened because:

1. **Missing Routes**: `/signup` and `/pro/signup` routes didn't exist, causing 404 errors
2. **Hardcoded Canonical**: The React app template had a hardcoded canonical URL that overrode dynamic canonical generation
3. **Broken Prerender Script**: The static HTML generation script had regex issues that prevented correct canonical URL replacement

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Missing Routes ✅
- **Created `/signup` route** with proper signup page component
- **Created `/pro/signup` route** with professional registration form
- **Updated React Router** in App.jsx to include both routes

### 2. Fixed Canonical URL Implementation ✅
- **Removed hardcoded canonical** from client/index.html template
- **Fixed prerender script regex** to handle both self-closing and opening canonical link tags
- **Updated build process** to use correct Vite dist directory instead of build directory
- **Fixed title replacement** to work with dynamic content

### 3. Generated Static HTML Files ✅
- **Route-specific static files** now exist for all major routes with correct canonical URLs
- **Proper SEO titles** for each route instead of generic homepage title
- **13 route variations** covered including service-specific pages
