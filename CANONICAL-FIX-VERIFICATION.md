# Canonical URL Fix Verification

## Problem Resolved
Fixed the core issue where all routes were serving the homepage canonical URL (`https://www.fixloapp.com/`) instead of route-specific canonical URLs.

## Before Fix (Production)
```bash
# All routes returned homepage canonical
curl -s https://www.fixloapp.com/how-it-works | grep canonical
# Output: canonical" href="https://www.fixloapp.com/"

curl -s https://www.fixloapp.com/services/plumbing | grep canonical
# Output: canonical" href="https://www.fixloapp.com/"

curl -s https://www.fixloapp.com/contact | grep canonical
# Output: canonical" href="https://www.fixloapp.com/"
```

## After Fix (Local Build)
```bash
# Each route now has its correct canonical URL
grep canonical how-it-works/index.html
# Output: <link rel="canonical" href="https://www.fixloapp.com/how-it-works"/>

grep canonical services/plumbing/index.html
# Output: <link rel="canonical" href="https://www.fixloapp.com/services/plumbing"/>

grep canonical contact/index.html
# Output: <link rel="canonical" href="https://www.fixloapp.com/contact"/>
```

## Expected Google Search Console Impact
This fix should resolve:
- **414 "Duplicate without user-selected canonical" pages** → Reduced significantly
- **105 "Alternate page with proper canonical tag" pages** → These may become properly indexed
- **14 "Excluded by 'noindex' tag" pages** → Should be unaffected
- **3 "Page with redirect" pages** → Should be unaffected  
- **84 "Crawled - currently not indexed" pages** → May improve with proper canonicals
- **1 "Duplicate, Google chose different canonical than user" page** → Should be resolved

## Technical Implementation
1. **Fixed pre-rendering script** (`scripts/prerender-canonicals.sh`)
2. **Generates route-specific HTML files** with correct canonical URLs
3. **Integrates with build process** automatically
4. **Deploys to root directory** for proper serving
5. **No server-side rendering required** - uses static file approach
