# GitHub Pages Jekyll Processing Fix

## Problem
GitHub Pages was failing to deploy with the error:
```
Conversion error: Jekyll::Converters::Scss encountered an error while converting 'assets/css/style.scss':
No such file or directory @ dir_chdir0 - /github/workspace/docs
```

## Root Cause
- GitHub Pages enables Jekyll processing by default
- Jekyll was looking for a `/docs` directory that doesn't exist
- Jekyll was trying to process SCSS files that don't exist in this repository
- This is a React/Node.js application, not a Jekyll site

## Solution
Added a `.nojekyll` file to the repository root to disable Jekyll processing.

## What the .nojekyll file does:
- Tells GitHub Pages to skip Jekyll processing
- Allows static files to be served directly
- Prevents SCSS conversion errors
- Maintains existing application structure

## Verification
The fix has been verified by:
- ✅ `.nojekyll` file created in repository root
- ✅ Main `index.html` file exists and loads correctly
- ✅ Static CSS files are accessible (`static/css/main.*.css`)
- ✅ Static JS files are accessible (`static/js/main.*.js`)
- ✅ Local static file serving test passed

## Result
GitHub Pages will now:
- Skip Jekyll processing
- Serve the HTML, CSS, and JS files directly
- Successfully deploy the Fixlo application
- No longer encounter SCSS conversion errors

This is the correct approach for this repository since it's a pre-built React application with static assets, not a Jekyll site.
