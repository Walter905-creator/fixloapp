# ðŸš€ Production Deployment Verification Guide

## Quick Verification Commands

Once deployed to Vercel, use these commands to verify all fixes are working:

### 1. Bundle Version Verification
```bash
# Check production bundle hash
curl -s https://www.fixloapp.com/ | grep -o "main\.[a-f0-9]*\.js" | head -1
# Expected: main.ba76f771.js (or newer)
```

### 2. SMS Opt-in Routing Test
```bash
# Test SMS opt-in page routing
curl -s https://www.fixloapp.com/sms-optin/ | grep "SMS Notifications - Fixlo"
# Expected: Should return title from SMS opt-in page

# Verify consent language
curl -s https://www.fixloapp.com/sms-optin | grep "I agree to receive SMS messages from Fixlo"
# Expected: Should find the consent text
```

### 3. API Proxy Verification
```bash
# Test API proxy routing
curl -s https://www.fixloapp.com/api/health
# Expected: Should return backend health response
```

### 4. Feature Flags in Production
Open browser console on https://www.fixloapp.com and run:
```javascript
// Check if feature flags are available
window.localStorage.setItem('debug', 'true');
// Then refresh page and check console for feature flag logs
```

## Manual Testing Checklist

### âœ… Bundle Deployment
- [ ] Visit https://www.fixloapp.com
- [ ] Open DevTools â†’ Network tab
- [ ] Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- [ ] Verify `main.ba76f771.js` (or newer) is loaded
- [ ] Check that no 404 errors for static assets

### âœ… SMS Opt-in Routing  
- [ ] Navigate to https://www.fixloapp.com/sms-optin
- [ ] Verify static compliance page loads (not React app)
- [ ] Check page contains "SMS Notifications - Fixlo" title
- [ ] Verify consent language: "I agree to receive SMS messages from Fixlo"
- [ ] Test both `/sms-optin` and `/sms-optin/` URLs

### âœ… API Functionality
- [ ] Visit https://www.fixloapp.com/api/health
- [ ] Should redirect/proxy to backend API
- [ ] Verify CORS headers allow www.fixloapp.com
- [ ] Test any form submissions work without CORS errors

### âœ… Environment Variables
- [ ] Check if any feature flags are visible in application
- [ ] Look for sharing functionality, badges, boost indicators
- [ ] Verify Cloudinary integration works if applicable
- [ ] No console errors about missing environment variables

## Expected Results

### Successful Bundle Deployment:
- Production serves `main.ba76f771.js` (or newer hash)
- All static assets load without 404 errors
- Page loads correctly without JavaScript errors

### Working SMS Opt-in:
- `/sms-optin` returns static HTML page (not React app)
- Page contains proper consent language and compliance info
- No routing to React app for this specific path

### Functional API Proxy:
- `/api/*` requests forward to `https://fixloapp.onrender.com/api/*`
- CORS headers properly configured
- Backend functionality accessible from frontend

### Active Feature Flags:
- `REACT_APP_FEATURE_SHARE_PROFILE=true`
- `REACT_APP_FEATURE_BADGES=true`
- `REACT_APP_FEATURE_7DAY_BOOST=true`
- `REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_ENABLED=true`

## Troubleshooting

### If bundle hash doesn't match:
1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Ensure latest commit was deployed
3. Clear browser cache and test again
4. Verify build command succeeded in Vercel

### If SMS routing doesn't work:
1. Check Vercel routing configuration deployed correctly
2. Verify `/sms-optin/index.html` file exists in deployment
3. Test both with and without trailing slash

### If API proxy fails:
1. Verify backend at `https://fixloapp.onrender.com` is running
2. Check CORS configuration on backend
3. Test API endpoints directly to isolate issue

### If feature flags missing:
1. Verify environment variables set in Vercel dashboard
2. Check Production environment specifically
3. Trigger new build after setting variables

## Success Criteria âœ…
