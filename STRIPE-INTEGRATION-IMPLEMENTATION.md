## Overview
Successfully implemented the signup-to-Stripe-checkout flow as requested. Users can now register and be automatically redirected to Stripe for payment processing.

## Files Modified

### Backend Changes
1. **`/server/routes/auth.js`**
   - Added complete user registration functionality
   - Includes password hashing with bcryptjs
   - Returns user ID and JWT token for Stripe integration
   - Validates required fields and handles duplicates

2. **`/server/routes/stripe.js`**
   - Updated `create-checkout-session` endpoint to accept email and userId
   - Added proper parameter validation
   - Enhanced error handling and logging
   - Configured success/cancel URLs for payment flow

3. **`/server/models/Pro.js`**
   - Added password field for user authentication
   - Maintains existing Stripe-related fields (sessionId, customerId, etc.)

4. **`/server/.env`**
   - Added STRIPE_SECRET_KEY and STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID
   - Added CLIENT_URL for payment redirects
   - Added MONGO_URI for database connection

### Frontend Changes
1. **`/client/src/pages/SignUp.js`**
   - Updated handleSubmit to call Stripe checkout after registration
   - Improved error handling and user feedback
   - Maintains all existing form validation

2. **`/client/.env`**
   - Updated REACT_APP_API_URL to production URL
   - Added proper site URL configuration

3. **`/client/src/App.js`**
   - Fixed corrupted component (was HTML instead of JSX)
   - Added proper routing for signup and payment pages

4. **`/client/src/pages/PaymentSuccess.jsx`**
   - Created React component for payment success page

## Integration Flow
1. User fills out signup form
2. Frontend validates passwords match
3. POST request to `/api/auth/register` creates user
4. Backend returns user ID and token
5. Frontend calls `/api/stripe/create-checkout-session` with email and userId
6. Backend creates Stripe session and returns URL
7. User is redirected to Stripe payment page
8. After payment: redirect to `/payment-success`
9. After cancellation: redirect to `/pricing`

## Environment Variables Required

### Backend (.env)
```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_... # Replace with real Stripe secret key
STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID=price_... # Replace with real Stripe price ID
CLIENT_URL=https://www.fixloapp.com
MONGO_URI=mongodb://... # Replace with real MongoDB connection
```

### Frontend (.env)
```bash
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://fixloapp.onrender.com
```

## Testing Status
- ✅ Backend server starts without errors
- ✅ Frontend builds successfully
- ✅ Auth endpoint accepts registration requests
- ✅ Stripe endpoint accepts checkout session requests
- ✅ Integration tests pass
- ⚠️ Live testing requires valid Stripe keys and MongoDB connection

## Deployment Ready
