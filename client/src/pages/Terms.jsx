        Welcome to Fixlo ("<strong>Fixlo</strong>," "<strong>we</strong>," "<strong>our</strong>," or "<strong>us</strong>").

        (the "<strong>Terms</strong>").
      </p>

      <h2>2. Marketplace Role</h2>

        the quality, timing, legality, or outcomes of any Services performed by Pros.
