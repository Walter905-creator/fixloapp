# Backend API Server Fix

## Issue Identified
The current deployment has a **BACKEND SPLIT ISSUE**:

- ‚úÖ **Frontend Static Files**: `https://handyman-connect-1-ftz8.onrender.com/` (serving React app correctly)
- ‚ùå **API Server**: `https://handyman-connect-1-1.onrender.com/api` (old service still running API)
- üîÑ **Frontend API Calls**: Correctly pointing to `handyman-connect-1-ftz8.onrender.com/api` (but this doesn't exist)

## What's Happening
1. The NEW render service (`handyman-connect-1-ftz8`) is ONLY serving static files (React build)
2. The OLD render service (`handyman-connect-1-1`) is running the API server
3. The frontend is correctly configured to call the NEW service for APIs, but the NEW service doesn't have the API running

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Fix New Service to Run Both Frontend + Backend (RECOMMENDED)
Update the new Render service to:
1. Build the React frontend in `/client`
2. Install backend dependencies in `/server`
3. Start the Express server which serves both API and static files

### Option 2: Update Frontend to Call Old Service
Change frontend to use `https://handyman-connect-1-1.onrender.com` (but this defeats the purpose of the new deployment)

### Option 3: Split Services (More Complex)
- Keep frontend on `handyman-connect-1-ftz8`
- Keep backend API on `handyman-connect-1-1` 
- Update CORS and environment variables

## RECOMMENDED FIX: Update Render Service Configuration

The current `render-backend.yaml` is configured incorrectly. It should be:

```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: handyman-connect-fullstack
    env: node
    plan: free
    buildCommand: |
      npm install --production
      cd client && npm install --production && npm run build
      cd ../server && npm install --production
    startCommand: cd server && node index.js
    envVars:
      - key: NODE_ENV
        value: production
      - key: CLIENT_URL
        value: https://handyman-connect-1-ftz8.onrender.com
      # ... other env vars
```

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Frontend code is correct (uses process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL)
- ‚úÖ Frontend build is correct (points to handyman-connect-1-ftz8.onrender.com)
- ‚ùå New Render service is not running the API server
- ‚ùå API calls return 404 because no Express server is running on the new service

## Next Steps
1. Update Render service configuration to run full Express server
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly on Render dashboard
3. Force redeploy the service
4. Test that both static files AND API endpoints work on the same domain
